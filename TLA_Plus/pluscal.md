# 算法与程序的区别

* Algorithms perform operations on arbitrary mathematical objects, such as graphs and vector spaces. Programs perform operations on simple objects such as Booleans and integers; operations on more complex data types must be coded using lower-level operations such as integer addition and method invocation.
* A program describes one method of computing a result; an algorithm may describe a class of possible computations. For example, an algorithm might simply require that a certain operation be performed for all values of i from 1 to N . A program specifies in which order those operations are performed.
* Execution of an algorithm consists of a sequence of steps. An algorithm’s computational complexity is the number of steps it takes to compute the result; defining a concurrent algorithm requires specifying what constitutes a single (atomic) step. There is no well-defined notion of a step of a program.
