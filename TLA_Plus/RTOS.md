In the next semantic level (L1) services and entities were added as found in most RTOS: Boolean events, counting semaphores, FIFO queues, resources, memory pools, mailboxes, etc. The formal modeling has allowed defining all such entities as semantic variants of a common and generic entity type. We called this generic entity a “Hub”. In addition, the formal modeling also helped to define “clean” semantics for such services whereas ad-hoc implementations often have side-effects.
